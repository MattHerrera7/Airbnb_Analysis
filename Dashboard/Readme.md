## Dashboard
For our dashboard we chose to use Tableau.  We felt that Tableau provided us with a vareity of options when it comes to visual analytics. We also feel that we are able to build dashboards and perform analyses very easily.  I contemplated using Microsoft Power BI (PBI) for this project.  PBI however does not appear to offer a user a opportunity to share their dashboard with others for free.  I also feel that building a calculated field in Tableau is more user friendly than the DAX calculatioins that need to be performed in PBI in to order to manipulate certain data.  The dashboard is fully functional and is being updated periodically.

In addition to Tableau, we will be utilizing Google Slides for our presentation.  Google Slides is a modern tool.  Based on the the current environment where many employees work from home, Google Slides is the ultimate tool becase it is hosted on the internet.  This means that coworkers are able to access and view it far easier than persentation built in PowerPoint. Google Slides is 100% free (always a plus in business), designed for collaboration an fully compatible  with other presentation tools.  Our presentations on Google SLides have been drafted below.
