# AirBnb Final Project


 ## TOPIC
 * Selected Topic
    * AirBnb rentals in Orlando, Kissimmee & Tampa
 * Reason why they selected their topic 
    * We chose this topic so that we could do a market analysis on the current state of AirBnB rentals in our target area, and also hopefully determine what factors impact whether or not the property is rented on a consistent basis. We have a desire to purchase property specifically for an AirBnb so we also want to determine the overhead costs and then hopefully determine a reasonable expected rate of return.

## SOURCE DESCRIPTION
 * Description of their source of data 
    * Datasource Provider: MashVisor (https://www.mashvisor.com/)
    * API Call: https://api.mashvisor.com/v1.1/client/airbnb-property/active-listings
    * Data regarding all active short-term rentals for the cities of Tampa, Orlando, and Kissimmee were obtained
    * More information regarding this particular API can be found at https://www.mashvisor.com/api-doc/#get-listings

## QUESTIONS
 * What does a financially succssful AirBnB look like?
   * How much revenue should one expect?
   * What is the typical star-rating?
   * How many days out of the year does it get rented out?
   * How many reviews does it typically have?
 * What factors/features contribute to that success? (# of pics, key words in description, beds, location, etc.)
 * Can we map out which locations (city, neighborhood, and/or zone) is most profitable or exhibits the most rentals?

 ## TECHNOLOGIES USED
 * Data Cleaning and Analysis: Pandas
 * Database Storage: PostGres SQL Database
 * Machine Learning: SciKitLearn
 * Dashboard: Tableau
 * Presentation: developing a group presentation within [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Dx93EKkndb-JcdpcIQliZplAEEWd6M3LfJBH-8bJwWs/edit#slide=id.gc6f980f91_0_0)


### Slack Group
 A Slack Group named "airbnb-analysis-team" was created for the purpose of sharing ideas and meeting online. All developers were invited into the group. Using Microsoft Project as our scheduling tool, an Master Schedule was created identifying the tasks, allocated resources, and due date for each task for each weekly segment. The schedule follows a goal of completing our tasks by Sunday, for group review on Monday and Tuesday, and final submission on Wedneday. Our group meets Tuesdays and Thursdays, and may i include ad-hoc meetings form time to time. 

 ### Team Member Assitance
 Should any members of the team require assistance, team members are to send a chat through Slack notifying all. All team members are expected to periodically review messages from the Team Chat so that questions can be answered as promptly as possible.

 ### GitHub Commit
 Team Members are expected to complete and commit their reviewed and fully tested tasks by due dates indicated in the schedule. Upon completion, and if the Team Member is ready for other to review and "MERGE", the Team Member will click on the "New pull request" option in GitHub.com. This action notifies the CM to review and merge the code.  If the Team Member believes he or she may miss their deadline, please contact the Team Lead so that further assistance can provided.

 ### Master Schedule
 For each of access to all Team Members, the Master Schedule was imported into an Excel spreadsheet called: [AirBnB Master Schedule](AirBnB_Master_Schedule.xlsx)


### Database

The database portion of this project revolves around the visualization of three .csv files; properties,property_locations, and Success_indicators. Included in the Images folder is the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). The primary tool used in this section was PGadmin4.
